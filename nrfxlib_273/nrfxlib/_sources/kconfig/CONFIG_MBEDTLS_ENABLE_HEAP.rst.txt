.. title:: MBEDTLS_ENABLE_HEAP

.. option:: CONFIG_MBEDTLS_ENABLE_HEAP

*Enable global heap for mbed TLS*

Type: ``bool``

Help
====

This option enables the mbedtls to use the heap. This setting must
be global so that various applications and libraries in Zephyr do not
try to do this themselves as there can be only one heap defined
in mbedtls. If this is enabled, then the Zephyr will, during the device
startup, initialize the heap automatically.

Direct dependencies
===================

\ :option:`NORDIC_SECURITY_BACKEND <CONFIG_NORDIC_SECURITY_BACKEND>`

*(Includes any dependencies from ifs and menus.)*

Defaults
========

No defaults. Implicitly defaults to ``n``.
